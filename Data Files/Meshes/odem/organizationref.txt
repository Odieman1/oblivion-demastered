--Naming Guide--

18 Character Limit because of meshes/odem/ = 12 and [LETTER]/ = 2.  32-14=18.
/dev folder has 16 character limit.

All names are lowercase only.

Shortening Order:

Sets go First.  3 letters, generally avoid vowels.  If the set has a very short name, vowels can be added.
Always use the first letter the set actually starts with, including vowels.
Really, you want to look at the 3 letters and be able to identify it.  dae for daedra is better that ddr because ddr makes me think of dance dance revolution.
Examples:

-Cities-
Bruma = brm
Cheydinhal = chy
Anvil = anv
Imperial City = imp

-Styles-
Daedra = dae
Oblivion = obl
Ayleid = ayl



A descriptor, 3-12 letters.  Two characters reserved for number codes.  Alternates use underscore letter codes with number codes, but always after numbers.
If no different meshes exist, for example say a unique item that can be broken: bitter_cup_r would be a ruined bitter cup.  deer_meat_s would be deer meat spoiled.
Feel free to use full words, but nothing over 12 letters.  Underscores count as letters. 


Examples:

pillar = plr01_r
wall = wll_r (wall ruined)
corner = crn05
arch = arc23
floor = flr58
table = tbl01_r
small = sml
large = lrg


Final Outcome should be less than or equal to 18 characters.

Examples:

meshes\odem\i\ayl_plr01 reads as ayleid pillar 1.
meshes\odem\f\ayl_blue_crystal01 is exactly 32 characters, and references a blue crystal furniture item in ayleid ruins.
meshes\odem\d\obl_gate_large would reference the final, unique, large gate (door) you enter at the end of the game.

Some dev examples and their uses:

meshes\odem\dev\256_act_cyl would be 27 characters, and references a cylinder used to visually reference an activator's 256 unit zone.
meshes\odem\dev\marker_blue would be 27 characters, and references a simple blue dev marker for visually referencing things.
meshes\odem\dev\note_marker is also 27 characters, references maybe a note to myself for the future.
meshes\odem\dev\bug_warn 24 characters, maybe a construction set object that tells me a player encountered a bug here during a playtest
