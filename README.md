# Oblivion Demastered

**Oblivion Demastered** is a total conversion project that recreates *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion* inside the **Morrowind engine**.

It is a ground-up reinterpretation of Cyrodiil using Morrowind’s mechanics as well as its constraints.

## Project Goals

The goal of Oblivion Demastered is to answer a simple question:

> *What would Oblivion have looked like if development started in 2000*
But also because I feel like it lol

To do that, this project focuses on:

- Designing content that respects **Morrowind’s engine limitations and jank**

---

## What This Project Is

- A **total conversion** for *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*
- A game set to the events of **Oblivion** with mechanics from **Morrowind**

---

## What This Project Is Not

- ❌ A direct asset rip or automated conversion  
- ❌ A 1:1 recreation of Oblivion’s gameplay systems  
- ❌ AI Art

---

## Development Philosophy

Oblivion Demastered is developed in **clear, staged milestones**:

- **Alpha** builds focus on cities, NPCs, and immediate surroundings
- **Beta** builds focus on world painting, quests, and narrative depth
- **Release Candidates** focus exclusively on Campaign completion and bug fixes.
- **Post-release (1.x)** builds include minor fixes only

## Installation

TBD

## Contributing

There should be no contributors.  I appreciate anyones enthusiasm but I think I can handle this myself.  I may be clueless and this might be laughable but I can try.

This is a **non-commercial fan project** created for educational and creative purposes.
