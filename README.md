# Oblivion Demastered

**Oblivion Demastered** is a total conversion project that recreates *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion* inside the **Morrowind engine**.

It is a ground-up reinterpretation of Cyrodiil using Morrowind’s mechanics as well as its constraints.


## Project Goals

The goal of Oblivion Demastered is to answer a simple question:

> *What would Oblivion have looked like if development started in 2000*

(But also because I feel like it lol)

To do that, this project focuses on:

- Designing content that respects **Morrowind’s engine limitations and jank**


## What This Project Is

- A **total conversion** for *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*
- A game set to the events of **Oblivion** with mechanics from **Morrowind**


## What This Project Is Not

- ❌ A direct asset rip or automated conversion  
- ❌ A 1:1 recreation of Oblivion’s gameplay systems  
- ❌ AI Art


## Development Philosophy

Oblivion Demastered is developed in **clear, staged milestones**:

- **Alpha** builds focus on cities, NPCs, and immediate surroundings
- **Beta** builds focus on world painting, quests, and narrative depth
- **Release Candidates** focus exclusively on Campaign completion and bug fixes.
- **Post-release (1.x)** builds include minor fixes only

## Community & Discussion

Development discussion, design decisions, and general feedback take place on the project’s discussion board.  The Wiki *should* have sections to help you with gameplay and info about differences between the original game and the Morrowind implementation.
The Board should show you info about progress on current builds.  All of these are open to discussion though, and I encourage it.

## Contributing

There should be no contributors.  I appreciate anyones enthusiasm but I think I can handle this myself.  I may be clueless and this might be laughable but I can try.
